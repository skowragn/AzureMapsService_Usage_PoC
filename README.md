# AzureMapsService_Usage_PoC
The Azure Maps Service API usage to find user country by IP.

# 1. Overview
The Azure Maps is a collection of geospatial services and SDKs that use fresh mapping data to provide geographic context to web and mobile applications. 
There are the following features:
 - REST APIs to render vector and raster maps in multiple styles and satellite imagery
 - Search services to locate addresses, places, and points of interest around the world
 - Various routing options; such as point-to-point, multipoint, multipoint optimization, isochrone, electric vehicle, commercial vehicle, traffic influenced, and matrix routing
 - Traffic flow view and incidents view, for applications that require real-time traffic information
 - Time zone and Geolocation services
 - Geofencing service with location information hosted in Azure
 - Location intelligence through geospatial analytics

# 2. Constrains

 1. Azure Maps Batches Search Address API:  the API limits the batch size toÂ 10000 queries per request.

 2. The Azure Portal free account allows up to 250,000 transactions per month.

# 3. Solution overview
In the source code example -> the Geolocation service is using with the following API:
```
https://atlas.microsoft.com/geolocation/ip/json?subscription-key={azureMapsKey}&api-version=1.0&ip={ipAddress}
```
to find user country by IP.

As the default USA IPv6 address is using: 2001:4898:80e8:b::189 (from Microsoft example).    

## 3.1. How to start
1. Use/Create an account in  Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com)

2.Create Azure Maps service

3. Authentication: Recommendation: Entra ID, but in the example: API Key is using (Shared Key Authentication) - Primary Key or Secondary Key

4. Copy Primary Key or Secondary Key into appsettings.json:

```
"AzureMapsSettings": {
    "AzureMapsSubscriptionKey": "{Primary Key}",
    "AzureMapsBaseUrl": "https://atlas.microsoft.com/"
}
```
5. There are two endpoints:

```
https://localhost:7218/api/AzureMaps/geolocation/{ipAddress?}
```

```
https://localhost:7218/api/AzureMaps/restsharp/{ipAddress?}
```

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/geolocation/get-ip-to-location?view=rest-maps-2024-04-01&tabs=HTTP

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8028e10c-00b9-4a9c-b0be-3514535179c7)

The first one is using MapsGeolocationClient client from Azure.Maps.Geolocation NuGet.

The second one is using RestSharp client to call directly the following API:

```
https://atlas.microsoft.com/geolocation/ip/json?subscription-key={azureMapsKey}&api-version=1.0&ip={ipAddress}
```

6. Result and API response model:

```
